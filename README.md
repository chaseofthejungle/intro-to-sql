# Intro to Structured Query Language (SQL)
  
**Overview:** A *database* is an organized data source/structure that should be easily accessible (by appropriately authenticated and authorized users, when relevant) for data management, retrieval, and long-term storage. *Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSes)* are specialized databases that store data in tables (and sometimes other structures, such as forms and queries in Microsoft Access software) and share data between tables using common columns. *Structured Query Language (SQL)* is a standardized language that performs RDBMS tasks such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (also known as 'CRUD' operations).

## 1. <a name="crud">CRUD Operations</a>

Persistent storage databases have four types of operations that are performed open them, which are commonly abbreviated as *CRUD*:

| CRUD Principle | Popular SQL Statement Keywords |
| :---: | :---: |
| **C**reate | INSERT INTO/VALUES, CREATE TABLE |
| **R**ead | SELECT |
| **U**pdate | UPDATE, ALTER TABLE/ADD |
| **D**elete | DELETE, DROP TABLE |

Several key differences between SQL and Not Only SQL (NoSQL) databases include:

| Feature | SQL | NoSQL |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Direction of Scalability | Vertical | Horizontal |
| Popular Objects | Tables | Column Stores, Documents, Graphs, Key-Value Pairs |
| Schemas | Predefined | Dynamic |
| Transaction Handling | Rows (Single or Multiple) | Unstructured Data (e.g., JSON) |
  
Some common reasons for choosing a NoSQL database include: quick response times/low latency, instant/real-time analytics, constantly-evolving data, and server scalability needs.

    - [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html)
    - [Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/)
    - [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/)
    - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
