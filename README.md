# Intro to Structured Query Language (SQL)
  
**Overview:** A *database* is an organized data source/structure that should be easily accessible (by appropriately authenticated and authorized users, when relevant) for data management, retrieval, and long-term storage. *Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSes)* are specialized databases that store data in tables (and sometimes other structures, such as forms and queries in Microsoft Access software) and share data between tables using common columns. *Structured Query Language (SQL)* is a standardized language that performs RDBMS tasks such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (also known as 'CRUD' operations).

TODO: Add 'key terms' section (e.g., column, field, primary key, foreign key).
